# Step 1: Planning and Design

## Define Requirements

- Identify the purpose of the application (e.g., web portal, document management, AI-driven insights).
- List functional and non-functional requirements (scalability, security, availability).

## Design Architecture

- Create a high-level architecture diagram.
- Define components like frontend, backend, databases, AI services, and networking.
